    <h3><i>What does this mean, to tell about myself?</i></h3>
    <pre>
      &ldquo;For me it is commensurated with a reading of a separate chapter of the book, for example:&quot;traces of becoming who you are today &hellip;&quot; or separate
      &quot;fragments about the evolution of a school pupil into a real specialist &hellip;&quot;
      Nothing passes by without leaving traces in our lives and everyone is aware of this and must understand.
      Let&apos;s get theoretical information from my database, the server of which is stored inside me.&rdquo;

      Let&apos;s get theoretical information from my database, the server of
      which is stored inside me&#9786;<br />The browser will send somewhere kind
      of this information to the server:<br /><b>Request</b><br />GET/HTTP/1.1
      Host:theoretical information.ksu<sub>&mdash;</sub>kuper<br /><b
        >Response</b
      ><br />HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      <br />
      This HTTP query was committed to the master/main line as a
      fragment/separate branch of my education's evolution at the Technological
      University.<br />I received my first higher education at the Technological
      University with a degree of a Certification Engineer with the right to
      hold following positions: Engineer; research/ control/ laboratory/
      quality/ metrology or standardization and certification Engineer.<br />The
      second HTTP query, stored inside me was committed to the master/main line
      as a fragment/separate branch of my education's evolution at the Technical
      University.<br />I received my second higher education at the Technical
      University with a degree of an Economist-Engineer.<br />These two branches
      allow me to update my hard skills and soft skills. From start of
      <del>the</del> 2022 year I was decided to the decision about a new long
      way of commit in my master/main line is the branch in the field of IT
      sphere. I was admitted to the IT-Academy on the Functional Manual Testing
      course.<br />Based on the above-mentioned, theoretical understanding and
      level of preparation for the role of Junior QA Engineer I could have
      stopped, but I didn&apos;t, because I like moving ahead and just to stop
      is not about me.<br />Artem Rusow became the navigator of the development
      process for me as a more advanced tester, who not only explained the
      alternate mechanism of immersion in testing, but also gave an opportunity
      to discover a wonderful coach - Oksana Melnikova.<br />IT-Switcher is a QA
      Engineer training school with the widest range of practical tasks.<br />Out
      of all the modules, there was the HTML/CSS/JS module, which I was first
      introduced to. I was so excited about what I did, and I can do moreâ€¦
      &#9786;<br />At that moment, I decided that I want to, and I will improve
      step by step!<br />Now!<br />I am travelling in the field of IT and
      leaving a mark on the path to self-development in front-end development,
      and I enjoy the road that leads me to the realization of my dreams.<br /><a
