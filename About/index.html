    I enjoy coding, figuring out and solving difficult problems.<br />I have no
    idea how to put into words what you feel inside when you do what gives
    pleasure - I have no idea!<br />But I get great pleasure from even where I
    am now going! My dream is to learn how to make clean code and see the result
    of the whole team's work as a finished project. And also so that QA Engineer
    does not find bugs!&#9786; Although this is unrealistic!<br />My strongest
    qualities are I myself! Sometimes I am surprised at myself how much I have
    evolved and continue to develop. Why do I have so much patience,
    perseverance and desire? After all, in school years, this was all
    absent!&#9786;<br />
    There is one unclosed issue in my biography - in 2010 I took a course to
    obtain a driver's license, so far the issue has not been closed&hellip;I
    think that the reason for everything is the lack of a personal car. This
    task is waiting for its turn in the list of goals and tasks!
